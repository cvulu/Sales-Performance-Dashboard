### Data Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Data cleaning and formatting.
3. Extracting data into new columns.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved exploring the shoe sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are the best sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?


### Results
The analysis results are summarised as follows:
1. The company monthly profit increased by 40% from Nov 2019 to Dec 2019, and then a further % from Dec 2019 to Jan 2020 before remaining steady for the rest of 2020.
2. Diabetic shoes are the best-performing category in terms of brand sales, while size 38 shoes are the most profitable.
3. ShipBob has the least shipping costs associated, with overall costs being at least 48% cheaper than the other companies despite similar levels of deliveries shipped.


### Limitations
- It would be good to get more info on shipping agencies, i.e. does price correlate with quality of service?
